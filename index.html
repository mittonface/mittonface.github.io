					The  City Centre Community School started in January of 2014 and is happy to be opening once again in January of 2015!
					It’s a a place to learn something new, meet members of the community, and most of all have fun!
					We welcome all members of the Charlottetown community and PEI at large to participate in a new selection of courses, starting January 6th at Colonel Gray High School.
					 For ten weeks, instructors with various backgrounds and experience will cover topics ranging from dance and healthy living, to web development and improv acting.
					 The school maintains a focus of providing material which hasn’t yet been offered in community schools on the Island before as well as offering longtime favourites.

                        With a committee led by young adults from around Charlottetown, the City Centre Community School is building on an existing community school platform, but with a different approach
                         and focus. Our goal is to raise awareness of the community school system in PEI, increasing its participation levels and the program’s sustainability for years to come.
                        <strong>Each class will be held on Tuesday evenings, 7:00pm – 8:30pm.</strong>
                        This includes a short break for community time, which gives a chance for students and instructors to share what they have learned or simply enjoy provided snacks and conversation.
                        It’s a great opportunity to mingle and meet people from around the community!

                    <p>
           Ever wanted to learn Latin, major language of literature, culture, and empire in western Europe for over 2000 years? Here's your chance! We'll start with basic vocabulary and grammar, and aim to be reading excerpts from real texts by the end of the course. This will be an introductory-level class, so if you've not studied a language since high school, that's fine: we'll be going over the basic rules of grammar, together with some tips on learning languages, in the first few classes. We'll also discuss some of the history and literature of the Latin language from ancient Rome to modern times. We will be using handouts rather than a textbook, but you will be expected to do some memorization.         
                    </p>

                    <h4>About Victoria</h4>
                    <p>
Victoria Goddard is a novelist, gardener, and jobbing humanist. After finishing a stint as a teaching fellow in the Foundation Year Programme at the University of King's College (Halifax), she spent six months walking down the length of England, six months as the sexton of a church in Halifax, and moved to Charlottetown in September of this year to write and look for land. She has a PhD in Medieval Studies from the University of Toronto, where she studied Dante and Boethius (a late Roman philosopher) and medieval Latin allegory, and also taught Latin to both beginners and doctoral candidates (and sometimes both!). She's delighted to join the Community School in 2015.

                    <p>You have regular access to a computer; you can turn on a computer; you can find, open and
                    install new programs on your computer; you see all these programs and files and wonder how
                    they work and how to make your own computer programs. You think: ‘all this computer stuff is
                    nice, but how can I use it to make the changes I want to see in my environment?’ You’re ready to
                    take the next steps but aren’t sure exactly where to begin. <br/> <br/>
                    If you decide to join, for a bit of context we’ll start with a whirlwind tour of the major
                    developments in Computation and Information Systems. We’ll also talk about recent
                    developments in the Maker movement: people who are leveraging the increasing power and
                    decreasing cost of technology to do truly amazing things for themselves like process automation,
                    data collection, and 3D printing.<br><br>

                    Then you’ll gain the tools you need to do these sorts of things for yourself.

                    <p>
                        Matt Duffy has been successfully taking things apart for decades, and has on several occasions
                        has managed to successfully put them back together. His megalomaniacal tendencies have led
                        to to use computers to exert control over the world around him. His gentler tendencies have led
                        him to offer to teach these skills to his community.

                    <p>The main goal of the classes will be to have fun and gradually <u>AND GENTLY</u> build up the skills of creating a team, and learning to
                    think on one's feet and creatively and imaginatively problem solve. The games cause participants to lose themselves in laughter,
                    confidence and joy through the fun of sorting out the problems in pairs or groups. Examples of some of the beginning exercises/
                    games would be: mirror exercise, slide show, sound scape, conducted story, and what am I doing?</p>

                    <p>Cameras these days have tons of features and just about any camera
                    can take a decent picture. The problem is knowing what all those settings do!
                    In our photography course you will learn photography basics such as how to frame a
                    photo, lighting, and techniques to getting the most out of your camera. Other
                    styles will be taught using different cameras and processes for getting the
                    most out of your picture opportunities.</p>

                    <h4>Course Description</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the ten weeks we will explore many different styles of yoga and meditation.
                    Focusing on the connection of the body and breath, each week we will move through a series of
                    asanas (poses) tailored to the interests and abilities of students. We will pay special attention
                    to correct alignment in the asanas and control of the breath. Classes will cater to all levels
                    of experience. As yoga involves much more than physical movement, the second half of class will
                    focus on different meditation techniques and their connection to our daily lives. Meditation
                    is the practice of calming and focusing the mind. Through forms of active and passive meditation
                    we will work on developing mindfulness.</p>

                        Kirstin Sweet has been practicing various styles of yoga for several years. She has developed a
                        true passion for the practice and believes that absolutely everyone can do yoga. In 2014, Kirstin
                        traveled to India and completed a yoga teacher training course in the foothills of the Himalayas.
                        There she learned how to effectively lead students in many styles of yoga and discovered many different
                        meditation techniques. She is excited to share her knowledge and passion for yoga with the students of

                    who want to learn how to write a short story by experiencing the actual process of writing
                    one (or several!). They will learn a little about the history of short stories, and everything
                    they need to know about what is needed to write a good short story. After the first meeting,
                    participants will experience several writing exercises that will result in the writing of
                    a short short story (often called flash fiction) or a component of a story. Works will be
                    published online in The Writing Pool (unless otherwise declared).</p>
