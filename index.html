                <h1>Hello friends!</h1>
                <p>My name's Brent and I'm the type of guy you'd expect to have a website: I do computer science
                    and programming. When I'm not working at my day at <a href="http://ookaisland.com">Ooka Island</a>
                    (they're dope), I'm working my night job of struggling through my MSc. at
                    <a href="http://omscs.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a> (also dope).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is an effort at amalgamating different projects that I've worked on. I hope that it also
                    encourages me to produce work that I'm not embarrassed to show other people.
                </p>
