					The  City Centre Community School started in January of 2014 and is happy to be opening once again in January of 2015!
					It’s a a place to learn something new, meet members of the community, and most of all have fun!
					We welcome all members of the Charlottetown community and PEI at large to participate in a new selection of courses, starting January 6th at Colonel Gray High School.
					 For ten weeks, instructors with various backgrounds and experience will cover topics ranging from dance and healthy living, to web development and improv acting.
					 The school maintains a focus of providing material which hasn’t yet been offered in community schools on the Island before as well as offering longtime favourites.
					</p>

                        With a committee led by young adults from around Charlottetown, the City Centre Community School is building on an existing community school platform, but with a different approach
                         and focus. Our goal is to raise awareness of the community school system in PEI, increasing its participation levels and the program’s sustainability for years to come.
                        Each class will be held on Tuesday evenings, 7:00pm – 8:30pm.
                        This includes a 30 mins break for community time, which gives a chance for students and instructors to share what they have learned or simply enjoy provided snacks and conversation.
                        It’s a great opportunity to mingle and meet people from around the community!

                    <p>You have regular access to a computer; you can turn on a computer; you can find, open and
                    install new programs on your computer; you see all these programs and files and wonder how
                    they work and how to make your own computer programs. You think: ‘all this computer stuff is
                    nice, but how can I use it to make the changes I want to see in my environment?’ You’re ready to
                    take the next steps but aren’t sure exactly where to begin. <br/> <br/>
                    If you decide to join, for a bit of context we’ll start with a whirlwind tour of the major
                    developments in Computation and Information Systems. We’ll also talk about recent
                    developments in the Maker movement: people who are leveraging the increasing power and
                    decreasing cost of technology to do truly amazing things for themselves like process automation,
                    data collection, and 3D printing.<br><br>

                    Then you’ll gain the tools you need to do these sorts of things for yourself.
                    </p>

                    <h4>About Matt</h4>
                    <p>
                        Matt Duffy has been successfully taking things apart for decades, and has on several occasions
                        has managed to successfully put them back together. His megalomaniacal tendencies have led
                        to to use computers to exert control over the world around him. His gentler tendencies have led
                        him to offer to teach these skills to his community.

                    <h4>Course Description</h4>
                    <p>The main goal of the classes will be to have fun and gradually <u>AND GENTLY</u> build up the skills of creating a team, and learning to
                    think on one's feet and creatively and imaginatively problem solve. The games cause participants to lose themselves in laughter,
                    confidence and joy through the fun of sorting out the problems in pairs or groups. Examples of some of the beginning exercises/
                    games would be: mirror exercise, slide show, sound scape, conducted story, and what am I doing?</p>

                    <h4>Course Description</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the ten weeks we will explore many different styles of yoga and meditation.
                    Focusing on the connection of the body and breath, each week we will move through a series of
                    asanas (poses) tailored to the interests and abilities of students. We will pay special attention
                    to correct alignment in the asanas and control of the breath. Classes will cater to all levels
                    of experience. As yoga involves much more than physical movement, the second half of class will
                    focus on different meditation techniques and their connection to our daily lives. Meditation
                    is the practice of calming and focusing the mind. Through forms of active and passive meditation
                    we will work on developing mindfulness.</p>

                    <h4>Course Description</h4>

                    <p>Not for the faint-hearted, Writing the Short Story is a workshop course for participants
                    who want to learn how to write a short story by experiencing the actual process of writing
                    one (or several!). They will learn a little about the history of short stories, and everything
                    they need to know about what is needed to write a good short story. After the first meeting,
                    participants will experience several writing exercises that will result in the writing of
                    a short short story (often called flash fiction) or a component of a story. Works will be
                    published online in The Writing Pool (unless otherwise declared).</p>
